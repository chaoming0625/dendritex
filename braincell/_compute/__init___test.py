"""Architectural guard for the layering of :mod:`braincell._compute`.

This module pins three properties of the package that were established by the
split of the old ``runtime.py`` monolith, and that nothing else enforces:

1. **No upward imports.** No production module in ``braincell._compute`` has a
   load-time import from ``braincell._multi_compartment``. ``_compute`` is the
   lower layer: ``Cell`` compiles itself down into a
   :class:`~braincell._compute.state.CellRuntimeState`, never the reverse. A
   package-level cycle between the two packages existed before the split and is
   what this assertion exists to stop from coming back.
2. **Acyclic.** The intra-package load-time import graph has no cycles.
3. **Layer order respected.** Within the runtime-construction chain the only
   legal direction is ``layouts -> ions -> bindings -> state``: a module may
   import its predecessors and never its successors.

Why static parsing
------------------

The graph is recovered with :mod:`ast`, not by importing anything. Three
reasons, in order of importance:

- A runtime check cannot see the property being asserted. The original
  ``_compute`` ↔ ``_multi_compartment`` cycle was importable — it only broke
  under particular import orders — so an :mod:`importlib`-based probe would
  have passed against the very code this guard is meant to reject.
- Parsing has no import side effects, so the guard cannot be perturbed by, or
  perturb, module state, JAX initialisation, or registry population.
- It runs in milliseconds over the whole package.

What counts as an edge
----------------------

Only *load-time* imports create an edge:

- Bodies guarded by ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` (or ``if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:``) are
  skipped. Four modules deliberately import under that guard to break an
  annotation cycle — ``layouts``, ``ions`` and ``bindings`` pull
  ``CellRuntimeState`` from ``.state``, and ``state`` pulls ``Cell`` from
  ``braincell._multi_compartment.cell``. All four are correct by design and
  must not be flagged.
- Imports nested inside a function or method body are deferred until the
  function is called and create no load-time edge, so the walker never
  descends into them.
- Imports inside a ``class`` body, or inside a module-level ``with``, ``for``
  or ``while`` body, **do** create a load-time edge: a class body and the
  bodies of these compound statements all execute when the enclosing module
  is imported, exactly like an ``if`` or ``try`` body does. The walker
  descends into all of them.
- Test modules (``*_test.py``, ``_testing.py``) are excluded entirely. A test
  importing ``Cell`` is not an architecture violation.

Known limitations
-----------------

The walker is a pragmatic AST match, not a full static-import resolver. The
following constructs are invisible to it. None appear in the codebase today;
if one is introduced, this guard will not catch it:

- ``match``/``case`` bodies (:class:`ast.Match`) are not descended into.
- ``except*`` bodies (:class:`ast.TryStar`) are not descended into.
- Dynamic imports — ``importlib.import_module(...)`` and ``__import__(...)``
  — are invisible; only literal :class:`ast.Import` / :class:`ast.ImportFrom`
  statements are matched.
- :func:`_production_modules` globs ``*.py`` non-recursively over
  ``_PACKAGE_DIR``, so a future ``_compute/<subpackage>/`` would be unscanned.
- :func:`_is_type_checking_guard` matches any attribute named
  ``TYPE_CHECKING`` regardless of its owner, so an unrelated
  ``if _Cfg.TYPE_CHECKING:`` would be (mis)treated as the real guard and its
  body skipped.
