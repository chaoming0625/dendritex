"""Static discretization types and the base build pipeline.

This module defines the immutable declaration-time objects that sit
between a :class:`~braincell.morph.morphology.Morphology` plus user
declarations and the runtime structures assembled later by
``braincell._compute``.

Two ideas shape the public surface here:

1. ``CV`` and ``CVTree`` are the membrane-oriented physical view of the
   discretization.
2. ``Node`` and ``NodeTree`` are a point-space view derived from those
   CV records for later point-tree assembly and runtime lowering.

The single formal build entry point is :func:`build_discretization`,
which returns a frozen :class:`Discretization` bundling both views.
