"""Locations and expectations for the on-disk morphology fixtures.

The leading underscore in the filename keeps pytest from discovering this
module as a test file. It is the single source for the fixture directory:
resolving ``parents[N]`` by hand at each call site meant four copies at two
different depths, one of which is easy to get silently wrong when a test file
moves between package levels.

Consumed by the reader tests under ``braincell/io`` and re-exported from
``braincell/vis/_testing.py`` for the visualization tests that render real
reconstructions.

``MANIFEST.in`` prunes ``data/`` from the source distribution, so this path

so a checkout with missing data fails loudly instead of quietly passing.
