"""Guards on ``braincell``'s own public surface.

``braincell/__init__.py`` exports the stable top-level API and domain packages.
Experimental namespaces are imported explicitly and have separate stability
contracts. Both kinds of non-underscored package are registered here so a new
directory cannot silently bypass the guard.
A name that drops out of ``__all__`` is a silent
break for ``import *`` users, and a name that stays in it after its module
is deleted is an ``AttributeError`` at import time.
